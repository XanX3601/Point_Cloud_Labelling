\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}

In the future, there are different ideas we would like to try in order to improve the performance of the approach. Changing the way of setting the voxel value during the voxelization step could put more information into the matrix. As suggested, changing the values to the density of points in each voxel would help to differentiate dense structure from clearer ones. We would like to study the augmentation of channels on the voxel. We think that including information such as colors, which is very common in images study, could lead to a big boost of performance. A simple operation as setting the value of each voxel to the average color of the points it contains may be sufficient to observe better performances.
